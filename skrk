Elise Stefanik, known for her staunch support for Israel, is slated to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Meanwhile, Susie Wiles will serve as the first female White House Chief of Staff, with adviser Stephen Miller as Deputy Chief of Staff. Rep. Mike Waltz, a strong critic of China, will serve as National Security Adviser. Finally, Tom Homan, previously an ICE official, will oversee border security in an unofficial role that doesn’t require Senate confirmation.
